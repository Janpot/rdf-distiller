# FIXME: this has been problematic, although it's not a good idea to
# use the embedded version of Ruby. It ends up not finding the right
# version of Ruby the first time, and does the second time, but
# the run of passenger-install-apache2-module does not get triggered,
# as it should form passenger::source. As a result the mod_passenger.so
# is never built
